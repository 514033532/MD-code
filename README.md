 Discovery of 55 Novel Toxins and A New oxidoreductase Based on Transcriptome Sequencing from Conus textile, and Biological Activity of TxO1VI/VII202401

pep.pdb is the predicted structure of the peptide.
3.1.pdb, 3.2.pdb, and 3.3.pdb are the docking results showing how the peptide binds to three different CAV (Caveolin) subtypes.
